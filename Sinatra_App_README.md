SHOE COLLECTION SINATRA APP

This app helps people keep track of their shoe collection (or the shoes they have, it doesn't have to be a collection.) Between me, my fiance and my dog, we have a lot of shoes. User can keep track of shoes by name and brand, they can edit shoes they already added, or delete any they've gotten rid of.
